This repository contains a shell script, `bootstrap.sh`, designed to make it easier to set up and manage Tuist projects. The script ensures that the Tuist CLI is installed and up to date, and it generates the Xcode project using `tuist generate`.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `bootstrap.sh` script, ensure the following are installed on your system:

1. **Homebrew**  
   Install Homebrew if it is not already installed. You can install it using the following command:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
